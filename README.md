# Tetris

Implementation of Tetris that I whipped up in JavaScript. There's no scoring.
You can't win. You can't lose. It's some sort of nihilist metaphor, perhaps
(?) ... or a toy to waste your brain's (and your CPU's) cycles on.

## Future Work

Look forward to links in the future to some videos where I talk through this
implementation!

* Because of the magic of JS, you can
  [run it in your browser](https://tinyurl.com/yyb3vvua); you
  *know* that you have CPU cycles to spare!

    * Keys to control this toy:

        * `←` / `→` move active tet left / right (respectively).

        * `↑` / `↓`rotate active tet clockwise / anticlockwise (respectively).

        * `<space>` move active tet down.

        * `p` toggle pause / unpaused state.
